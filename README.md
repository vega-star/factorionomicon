# FACTORIONOMICON ‚öôÔ∏èüîß

Factorionomicon is my personal book of blueprints for Vanilla/Space Age gameplay which I've added modular and scalable designs to easen refactoring and starting from scratch. Also to share my friends and teach them how to play the game from a solid foundation.

## How to import?

You can import the book anytime in the game with the <kbd>Import String</kbd> button in the right side of the toolbox, as displayed below:

Copy raw file as demonstrated above then paste the **gigantic wall of text** inside [Factorionomicon](FACTORIONOMICON.txt) in the propmpt, and voil√†!

## Why?

**The factory must grow.**
